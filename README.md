# Speech Recognition System (CODTECH Internship Task 2)

## 📌 Objective
Build a basic speech-to-text system using pre-trained models or libraries.

## ✅ Features
- Converts short speech/audio to text.
- Uses Python's `SpeechRecognition` library.
- Prints transcribed text directly.

## 🛠️ Installation
Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install pyaudio
```

If `pyaudio` fails on Windows, install via:
```bash
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```

## ▶️ Usage
Run the script:

```bash
python speech_to_text.py
```

Then speak into the microphone. The script will transcribe and display your speech.
